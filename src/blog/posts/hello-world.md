Welcome to the new home of **Doctrine & Data**.

After several years on Blogspot, I've moved the blog to my main site at reichert.law. This new platform gives me more control over the presentation and allows for better integration with my academic and consulting work.

## What to Expect

This blog will continue to focus on:

- **Trademark law** — particularly empirical analysis of doctrine
- **Patent practice** — insights from the trenches
- **Empirical legal studies** — methodology and findings
- **Law and technology** — including AI and legal practice

If you've been following along on Blogspot, thank you for your readership. The [archive remains available](https://doctrineanddata.blogspot.com/) for older posts.
